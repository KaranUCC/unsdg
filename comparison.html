    <h1>Comparison of the Goals</h1>
    <h2>Comparing and Contrasting the 2 Goals</h2>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p>Goal 14 focuses on conserving and sustainably using our oceans, seas, and marine resources. Goal 14 targets challenges like overfishing, marine pollution, and the degradation of marine ecosystems. If the targets are met, Goal 14 ensures the long-term health and productivity of the ocean and marine ecosystems.</p>
    <p>Goal 15 centers around protecting, restoring, and sustainably managing our terrestrial ecosystems and forests. It targets challenges like deforestation, desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss. Goal 15â€™s targets include promoting sustainable land practices, conserving natural habitats, and combating illegal wildlife trade.</p>
    <p>Though both goals focus on completely different ecosystems, interestingly, they contribute to each other's objectives by acknowledging the interconnectedness of land and water ecosystems. They recognize that the health of our marine ecosystems can be influenced by activities on land, such as pollution and deforestation. Similarly, land ecosystems rely on healthy oceans for important functions like climate regulation and water cycles. Though some see these goals as opposites (land and water), they complement each other and have a symbiotic relationship where one can't live without the other.</p>
    <p>While both goals share a common focus on preserving and sustainably using our natural resources, they do, however, target different ecosystems. Goal 14 is primarily concerned with marine environments, recognizing the immense significance of oceans and seas. On the other hand, Goal 15 places its emphasis on terrestrial ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and other land-based habitats. Though there are various similarities between the 2 goals, fundamentally they are different and have different approaches to their own problems.</p>
